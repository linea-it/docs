The **LIneA Occultation Prediction Database** is a scientific service that provides systematic and updated access to predictions of stellar occultations by minor Solar System bodies. Developed by LIneA's Solar System Portal, the system integrates updated orbital data with the Gaia DR3 stellar catalog, using specialized algorithms to calculate ephemerides and occultation circumstances. The service is designed to serve both professional research applications and citizen science projects.

## Main Features
The platform provides **programmatic access** via a RESTful API with endpoints for querying by object identification (name or designation), dynamic classes (Skybot classification), stellar parameters (magnitude), geographic filters, etc. The **interactive web interface** allows tabular viewing of events, display of dynamic prediction maps, and download of SORA maps and KMZ files.

Additionally, the service provides a **Python package** ([`lineaSSP`](https://github.com/linea-it/lineassp)) for integration into scientific workflows and a **subscription service** for customized event notifications.
