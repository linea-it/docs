The **Sky Viewer** (**skyviewer.linea.org.br**) is an in-development service based on the Aladin visualization tool that displays HIPS images and catalog overlays from various sources, including publicly available online data and public/private data hosted at LIneA. The list of available datasets depends on each user's access rights.

Like the Target Viewer, the Sky Viewer was originally developed for the DES survey, and its initial version is still available on the [DES Science Server](https://scienceserver.linea.org.br/) page, providing access to DES DR2 images and tabular data. The new version, being developed as part of IDAC-Brazil's service portfolio, will be flexible and provide LSST data access for members, plus public data from other surveys for the general community.
