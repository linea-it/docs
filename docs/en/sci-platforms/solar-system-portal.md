The study of small bodies in the Solar System presents considerable challenges, primarily due to their small sizes and vast distances. One method to overcome these obstacles involves indirect studies through the **stellar occultation** technique.

Historically, accurate prediction of these events has been difficult due to the lack of sufficiently precise stellar maps. However, recent advances have transformed this scenario, enabling highly precise predictions of stellar occultations for Solar System bodies. The stellar occultation technique is crucial for studying these bodies, particularly trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs), providing accurate information about sizes and positions, environmental characteristics, etc. This is possible thanks to one of the technique's most notable features: the conversion of high temporal resolution into high angular resolution.

With the expected **tenfold increase in data volume** from the *Legacy Survey of Space and Time* (LSST), the **Solar System Portal** emerges as a high-performance computing solution for:

1. Calculating predictions for stellar occultation events;
2. Organizing and distributing data;
3. Making events globally accessible;
4. Reducing the user's computational load;
