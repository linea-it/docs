## LIneA Science Platform
The LIneA Science Platform (**scienceplatform.linea.org.br**) is an online platform, still under development, that will aggregate a set of services and tools offered to facilitate access and analysis of astronomical data hosted at LIneA. Currently, a test version of the platform is available for user evaluation at [**scienceplatform-dev.linea.org.br/lsp**](https://scienceplatform-dev.linea.org.br/lsp).

### IDAC Science Platform
During the operation of the [LSST](https://rubinobservatory.org/) survey, a reduced version of the LIneA Science Platform, containing only services related to the LSST project, will be the main access point to data hosted at the [_Brazilian Independent Data Access Center_ (IDAC-Brazil)](https://www.linea.org.br/idac) for scientists in the Brazilian community.

In the years preceding LSST operations, IDAC-Brazil services already provide access to public data from other surveys, such as the [Dark Energy Survey](https://www.darkenergysurvey.org/), so the community can prepare and familiarize themselves with the various tools offered.

### Services
