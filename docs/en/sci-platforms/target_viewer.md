The **Target Viewer** ([**targetviewer.linea.org.br**](https://targetviewer.linea.org.br)) is an in-development service customized for viewing astronomical images based on a predefined target list specified by the user.

**Step by step:**
1. Create a new target list as a table in the user's *MyDB* space in **User Query**. For the Target Viewer to locate the target images, the table must contain the columns `objectId`, `ra`, and `dec`.
2. Click the **"NEW CATALOG"** button on the Target Viewer homepage and complete the 3-step form to register the table as a target list.
3. After submitting the form, the target list will appear in the menu on the homepage.

Like the Sky Viewer, the Target Viewer was originally developed for the DES survey, and its initial version is still available on the [DES Science Server](https://scienceserver.linea.org.br/) page, providing access to DES DR2 images and tabular data. The new version, being developed as part of IDAC-Brazil's service portfolio, will be flexible and provide LSST data access for members, plus public data from other surveys for the general community.
