The **User Query** ([**userquery.linea.org.br**](https://userquery.linea.org.br/)) is a user-friendly interface for database queries that enables the creation of temporary tables. User-generated tables are managed by MyDB and can be immediately accessed in LIneA's JupyterHub or from anywhere via the TAP Service. Additionally, if a table contains equatorial coordinates and a column with unique identifiers, it automatically becomes a target list, allowing visualization of corresponding object images in the [Target Viewer](/docs/sci-platforms/target_viewer.md) tool (LSST images for members and DES DR2 images for the general public).

### TAP Service
The [IVOA](https://ivoa.net/index.html) TAP Service (Table Access Protocol) is a standard that enables access and querying of astronomical databases through SQL language, in a standardized and interoperable way across different services. In addition to the User Query service, public catalogs hosted at LIneA can also be accessed remotely via the TAP Service using [TOPCAT](https://www.star.bris.ac.uk/~mbt/topcat/) or programmatically through the Python library [`pyvo`](https://pyvo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#). Visit the [TAP Service documentation](https://userquery.linea.org.br/cms/services/scripted-access/) on the User Query website for more details on how to use the service.
