Inspired by the DES Science Portal, the PZ Server ([**pzserver.linea.org.br**](https://pzserver.linea.org.br/)) is being developed as part of LIneA's in-kind contribution to LSST to be an online service, complementary to the [Rubin Science Platform](https://data.lsst.cloud/), for storing and sharing auxiliary data related to photo-z (photometric redshifts). It will enable data management, user sharing, and provenance control.

Hosted at IDAC-Brazil, the service will be available to all users with LSST data access, without geographical restrictions. Its code will be open-sourced on GitHub, as required by the in-kind contribution agreement between LIneA and Rubin Observatory.

The data hosted on PZ Server can also be accessed through the Python library `pzserver` (see the [Jupyter notebook with library usage tutorial](https://github.com/linea-it/pzserver/blob/main/docs/notebooks/pzserver_tutorial.ipynb) and the [API documentation page](https://linea-it.github.io/pzserver/) for more details).

The initial focus is to support the PZ Validation Cooperative during LSST's testing phase, enabling the sharing of standardized datasets for algorithm comparison. Afterward, it will remain useful for the LSST community in managing various test files.
