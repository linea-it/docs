The MaNGA portal ([**manga.linea.org.br**](https://manga.linea.org.br/)) was developed to meet the needs of members of the Brazilian Participation Group in the MaNGA survey of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The system was designed to allow the team to visualize not only the reduced IFU (Integral Field Units) spectroscopy data cubes, but also the results of data analysis showing maps of various physical quantities derived from the spectra.

For more information on how to use the service, see the [tutorials](https://manga.linea.org.br/tutorials) on the MaNGA portal website.
