# Photo-z Server Data

## Datasets classification   

### Official Datasets 

The official datasets will be produced by Rubin's Data Management team and will be available to the LSST Community through the Photo-z Server. These datasets will include reference redshift catalogs, training sets, and photo-z estimates associated with the LSST data releases. The datasets will be released in a phased manner, starting with the first data release (DR1) and continuing with subsequent releases as the LSST survey progresses.

For now, the [Rubin Observatory PZ Data Products](https://pzserver.linea.org.br/oficial_products) page is empty. 

### Unofficial Datasets 

The [User-generated Data Products](https://pzserver.linea.org.br/user_products) page is hosting a set of datasets that were prepared by the LIneA team for educational purposes, to serve as use case examples for the Photo-z Server tutorials. In addition, the DP1 datasets generated by PZ Science Unit from Rubin’s Commissioning Team, described in the tech note [SITCOMTN-154](https://sitcomtn-154.lsst.io/) are also available. All these datasets are not classified as Official Datasets released by Rubin's Data Management team.
