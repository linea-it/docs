Welcome to the LIneA's **User Documentation** page. This is the central hub to find user guides and documentation about all services and tools provided by LIneA for the astronomical community and the general public. Here you will also find links to relevant external documentation.  

LIneA - Interinstitutional Laboratory for e-Astronomy - is a multi-user laboratory, operated by a non-profit organization (LIneA Association) with financial support primarily from the Brazilian Ministry of Science, Technology, and Innovation.  

Our mission is to work to support the Brazilian astronomical community with computational infrastructure and expertise in _big data_ analysis to provide the technical conditions for participation in major astronomical surveys, such as the _Sloan Digital Sky Survey_ [(SDSS)](https://www.sdss.org), _Dark Energy Survey_ [(DES)](https://www.darkenergysurvey.org), and _Legacy Survey of Space and Time_ [(LSST)](https://rubinobservatory.org).
