LIneA has an approved "umbrella" project at [LNCC](https://lncc.br/) called "_Exploring the Universe via big data: from the solar system to dark energy_" (acronym EUBD) that guarantees the right to use 2 million CPU hours of the [Santos Dumont supercomputer](https://sdumont.lncc.br/) to support some subprojects that depend on _High-Performance Computing_ (HPC) in the following areas:

1. Solar System
2. Milky Way/Local Volume
3. Dark Energy
4. Large-Scale Structures
5. Photometric Redshifts (LSST in-kind contributions program)

!!! info 
    If your project has HPC demands and is not yet part of the EUBD project scope, contact us at [helpdesk@linea.org.br](mailto:helpdesk@linea.org.br) for guidance.
