# Usage Policy
Usage Policy of the Computational Infrastructure of the Interinstitutional Laboratory of e-Astronomy - LIneA.
This Usage Policy of the Computational Infrastructure of the Interinstitutional Laboratory of e-Astronomy covers all computational resources made available for scientific research. This set of rules aims to:

 1. Ensure a friendly, productive and reliable computational environment;
 2. Maintain an environment that allows development and innovation;
 3. Safeguard the reputation of the Interinstitutional Laboratory of e-Astronomy (LIneA) and protect its computing systems and the data they contain against external attacks and unauthorized use;
 4. Ensure compliance with all legal guidelines.

All users must strive to maintain the security of the environment. The user account is for exclusive, personal use and cannot be shared. Unauthorized access attempts aimed at damaging, altering, falsifying or deleting data, falsifying email addresses or causing service interruptions are prohibited.

LIneA's computational resources must be used solely and exclusively for the execution of tasks related to previously registered scientific projects. It is expressly prohibited to use these resources for:

1. Illegal activities of any nature;
2. Activities that offend or result in public embarrassment of collaborators, users or third parties;
3. Activities involving personal financial gain;
4. Download, upload or storage of material with sexual or illegal content;
5. Execution of tasks that use an amount of resources incompatible with infrastructure sharing and that interfere with the overall system performance;
6. Execution of tasks that result in violation of licenses of previously installed computational applications;
7. Distribution or storage of music, movies, or any material protected by copyright without proper license.

Questions about the appropriateness of the use of computational resources should be communicated directly to LIneA via [Service Desk](../suporte.md).

Data in *SCRATCH* does not have backups. Critical data must be saved by the user in their HOME directory and is their own responsibility. More details about [storage systems](../armazenamento/index.md).

Every user is required to immediately report any suspicion of violation of security rules by sending an email to <helpdesk@linea.org.br>.

LIneA values the privacy of all collaborators and users. No query or inspection will be made of files without the user's authorization, except in situations involving compromise of system security.

Every user of LIneA's computational infrastructure commits to:

    * Include in all articles submitted to scientific journals, conference proceedings, theses, dissertations, etc., that make use of LIneA's computational resources, the following acknowledgment:

        "This research was supported by resources supplied by the Laboratório Interinstitucional de e-Astronomia (LIneA)."; or,

        "Esta pesquisa tornou-se possível graças aos recursos computacionais disponibilizados pelo Laboratório Interinstitucional de e-Astronomia (LIneA).";
        
    Forward to CDE a copy of the aforementioned publication which should be included on LIneA's official website.
