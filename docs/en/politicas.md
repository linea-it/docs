# Information Security Policy (ISP)

The Information Security Policy (ISP) of LIneA defines strategic guidelines on how Information Security will be addressed within the association's environment. 
It was developed by the Information Security Management Committee (CGSI/LIneA) with support from RNP's Security Incident Response Center (CAIS/RNP), and covers various aspects of information security, defining roles and responsibilities for both LIneA Association and its collaborators and users.
